Algorithm comparison in stock price prediction

The code used for the experiment is in the AlgoComparisonNotebook.ipynb

It is seperated into following parts:
- data preprocessing using web scraping and visulization on the data internal correlation
- Regressor model run for the cross-company prediction (with prediction graph and RMSE)
- Auto Arima run for Lululemon's part performance (with prediction graph and RMSE)
- Prophet run for Lululemon's part performance (with prediction graph and RMSE)
- LSTM run for Lululemon's part performance (with prediction graph and RMSE)
- ANN model combine the results from LSTM and Regressor to do predition on High and Low

##Except the preprocessing, each step generates the RMSE and graphs for performance evaluation
